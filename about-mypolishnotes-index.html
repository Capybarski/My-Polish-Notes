    <header><p7><b><em>ABOUT MY POLISH NOTES</em></p7></b><br><br>
        <p1>I tried making this website to look like just a blog site, but my friends tell me it looks so professional. I don't know what to feel because in a sense they mean well, but I spent months just to make it look everything but professional. I just thought you wanna know. Anyway, here goes the 'heart' of this website:</p1>
        <br>
    </header>

    <div class="main">
        <span id="TheConcept">
        <h1>THE CONCEPT</h1>
        <p><img src="Images/jeanpolmartin.jpg" id="img1">
            As I was preparing this website (by watching online tutorials, as you know, I'm not a pro-website creator or anything alike), I stumbled upon a brief yet brilliant quotation, <i>"we teach to learn."</i> While I can hardly remember where that came from or who said that, I knew about this, but never really applied it to myself. This is the so-called "Teaching by Learning" where one's understanding is tested and improved by teaching what he/she knows using only the simplest of words he/she can come up with.<br>
            <br>

            And by that, you may already know that I created My Polish Notes so that I can force myself to show (teach) something while learning it, reviewing what I put in here, and by doing so, establish my knowledge of the subject, needless to mention, Poland.<br>
            <br>

            In other words, this is simply a blog site of (redundantly) my personal thoughts and impressions about Poland. This also comes as a gift for my <img src="Images/pyramid.png" id="img2"><br>
            <br>

            "Teaching by learning (German:Lernen durch Lehren, LdL)" is a studying technique to deeply understand a concept, or anything one wants to learn. This fits right to what the <span class="highlightred">learning pyramid</span> tells us, that there is a 90% retention rate when one teaches others of what he/she wants to learn.
            <span class="highlightyellow"> Jean-Pol Martin</span>, a language teacher in German schools, developed this efficient way to learn things. If you want to read more about
            this, click on <a href="#">this link.<a>

            At the time of writing, what I know about Poland is as much as what a language enthusiast does. Not too little, not too much   either, compared to a native, of course. And this
            is my way of addressing that small problem of mine, because I certainly would love to go to Poland not later than 10 years from now. In
             a way, I am 'forcing myself to voluntarily' learn more about Poland. I don't know if it makes sense, but anyway, this is what I do,
             and it works.

            <h1>THE REASON</h1>
            <p>Besides the fact that the design of this website is clearly an antithesis to my undergrad research about blue light and its adverse effects, this also has alot of advantages. Like it must be someone's favorite color. But scientifically speaking, blue color has "an energizing" effect to a person, and you will probably remember what you were reading if the text is in blue or the surrounding objects are blue.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you're reading up until this point, you'll obviously know that this also comes as a gift to a friend who just turned
                17 years old this November 2020. This is not something a normal person would give to someone as a birthday present, but then, I'm not
                normal,
                neither is she (just kidding). At first, I tried to build this website using Notepad like the way she does, but I realized that it
                would
                be alot easier to work using a more convenient coding app, so I did. I'd really like to create this using Notepad just to try and see if I can do the same,
                but here we have it.<br>

    <div class="main">
        <h1>MY LANGUAGE LEARNING</h1>
        <p>I've been learning the Polish language for almost 9 months now, so it is time for delivery. While I embarrass myself writing that
            joke, I am really proud of what I am achieving now. I can handle basic Polish conversations now. You can probably see my name topping
            the weekly ClozeMaster rankings because I enjoy competing that way while learning the language.
            
            During the first month of language learning, I did chat with some native speakers online, but I quit the apps after the first week of use because 
            I was so unsure if I could speak my mind so clearly. I know mistakes help, but I couldn't even say "I'm hungry" at that time, and
            the goal is not to die in hunger in just a week if I were to stay in Poland.
